"Uncertainly"
by Ourselves the Elves

An oath of silence
My feelings swore to
Not to be spoken of again
But I like to think you too, keep quiet
I'll never shout it out to the world
That I feel a certain way
But I don't want things to change
I swore to the heavens
I swore to the sea
I swore that I'd make you
Stay with me
An oath of silence
I swore to myself
It makes me all the more confused
Picture perfect agreement
I,
I wasn't sure you understood
That I feel a certain way
But I don't want things to change
I swore to the heavens
I swore to the sea
I swore that I would make you
Stay with me
I swore to the mountains
I swore to the trees
I swore that I'd set you
Set you free
