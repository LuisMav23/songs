I 2 I
by Tevin Campbell

I got myself a notion, one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion by reaching out for each other's hand
Maybe we'll discover what we should have known all along
One way or another together's where we both belong

If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For the first time ever we're seeing it I 2 I

If a wall should come between us to high to climb, to hard to break through
I know that love will lead us and find a way to bring me to you
So don't be in a hurry, think before you count us out
You don't have to worry, I won't ever let you down

If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For the first time ever we're seeing it I 2 I

If you're ever lonely, stop, you don't have to be
After all is stolen, I'll beat a way from you to me
Take a look inside and see
(Yeah)

If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For the first time ever we're seeing it I 2 I
